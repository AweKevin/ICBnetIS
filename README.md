# ICBnetIS
A predictive network-based immune checkpoint blockade immunotherapeutic signature optimizing patient selection and treatment strategies

## Development of network-based immune checkpoint blockade immunotherapeutic signature (ICBnetIS)

Our approach involved selecting key gene module by co-expression network analysis and identifying crucial gene sets via molecular interactions network analysis. After the construction of ICBnetIS, to explore the benefits of ICBnetIS in predicting ICB therapy response, we utilized extensive ICB therapy data from over 700 samples of various cancer types. Remarkably, the predictive efficacy of ICBnetIS outperformed previously published ISs.
